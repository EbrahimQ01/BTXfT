# BTXfT

This is an approximately one-day hobby project inspired by Twitter. 

I used AI (ChatGPT) to generate the front-end code, making only minor edits, as I dislike working on UI. However, I wrote all the Python code myself and utilized AI to help find solutions to my problems instead of searching manually.
